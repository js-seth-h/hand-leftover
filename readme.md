# httpware-leftover

> At the end of call chain, it send 404 or 500(when error exists).
> responsed html is customizable.
> written by coffeescript

## Features

* developer takes permission to control 404 / 500 response
* prevent `no answer` from http server 
* compatible with connect


# Why was this made?

[flyway][ho] is fully compatible with connect's middleware.
So, first my attempt is using [errorhandler][eh].
but, in [errorhandler][eh] , 404(page not found) is also `Error` ( it means I have to throw `new Error '...'`)

[ho]: https://www.npmjs.org/package/flyway
[eh]: https://www.npmjs.org/package/errorhandler

My opinion about 404 is differnt.
`Page not found` is naturally occured when all middleware didn't process request.

I need more flexible one.


## Example

 ```coffee 

    server = http.createServer flyway [
#      ... something you need
      leftover()
    ]
 

 ```
basic usages.

 ```coffee 

    server = http.createServer flyway [
#      ... something you need
      leftover
        '404':
          html: "<h1> Page Not Found </h1>"
    ]

 ```
static html text is possible.


 ```coffee  

    server = http.createServer flyway [
#      ... something you need
      leftover
        '404' :
          html: (callback)-> callback 'callback'
    ]

 ```
function is possible too.

```coffee
    server = http.createServer flyway [
      (req,res,next)-> next new Error 'Just Error' 
      leftover
        '500' :
          html: '500'
    ] 
# or 
    server = http.createServer flyway [
      (req,res,next)-> next new Error 'Just Error' 
      leftover
        '500' :
          html: (error, callback)-> callback error.toString()
    ]

```

with error handler, it is also possible using text or function.
